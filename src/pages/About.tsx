                  <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Learning Hub was born from a simple belief: that complex topics in AI, machine learning, 
                    and system design don't have to be intimidating. They can be broken down, beautifully 
                    presented, and genuinely enjoyable to learn.
                  </p>

                    This platform is my personal learning space â€” a digital garden where I've organized 
                    everything I've learned and continue to explore. By sharing it, I hope to help others 
                    on their own learning journeys.

                    Throughout my learning journey, I found that the best way to truly understand something 
                    is to organize it, explain it, and share it. This platform is both my notebook and my 
                    teaching tool. It's constantly evolving as I learn new concepts and discover better 
                    ways to explain them. If it helps even one person on their learning path, it's worth it.
